    <!-- ABOUT -->
    <br />
    <p class="dark:text-slate-50 text-lg sm:pl-4 text-center sm:text-left">
        Centurion is a Discord bot bespoke designed and built for the Cent's Lounge Discord community, built with Node.js and Discord.js. The bot started as a simple moderation tool but grew into a fully
        fledged economy bot with a variety of custom features and commands. 
    </p>
    <br />
    <p class="dark:text-slate-50 text-lg sm:pl-4 text-center sm:text-left">
        The economy features a custom levelling system which rewards users for being active in the server, as well as providing randomised "item drops" which users can use to craft other items and earn
        "cents", our custom currency. Other smaller features in the economy included pets, fishing and dungeons! The bot also featured a suite of moderation tools for community moderators to use, including a 
        full punishment system that integrated into Discord's first-party moderation tools.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p class="dark:text-slate-50 text-lg pt-4 sm:pl-4 text-center sm:text-left">
        The codebase for Centurion is open source and available on GitHub at <Link href="https://github.com/sirarchibald97/centurion-public" text="github.com/sirarchibald97/centurion-public" />, 
        however both the bot and the community are no longer maintained.

    <!-- FUTURE UPDATES -->

        <p class="dark:text-slate-50 text-lg pt-4 text-center sm:text-left">
            Whilst the project is no longer maintained, before it was axed there were several features I was working on, the most notable of which was a dungeon crawling minigame. This would have
            allowed members to form dungeon parties and explore randomly generated dungeons with monsters to fight and loot to collect. 
        </p>
        <p class="dark:text-slate-50 text-lg pt-4 text-center sm:text-left">
            The second feature I wanted to implement was an idle fishing system where members could periodically fish for items, coins and other loot! This idea could've been expanded even more into more idle 
            minigames such as mining, farming and more.
