        I'm a year old developer from the UK, and I go by SirArchibald online. I created this website to showcase some of my own work, teams I have been a part of, as well as 
        other info about me!
    </p>
    <p class="dark:text-slate-50 text-lg pt-4 pl-4">
        I have 8 years experience with programming and mostly develop for Minecraft and the web. I'm currently studying an undergraduate degree in software engineering, where I am 
        in my third and final year.

        In my spare time, I enjoy playing video games, reading fantasy novels and swimming! I am also a moderator for, a 
        Minecraft server created by Noxcrew.
